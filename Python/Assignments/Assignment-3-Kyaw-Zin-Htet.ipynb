    "**Objective:**\n",
    "To test your understanding of functions in Python, you are required to build a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person's weight and height. It can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BMI is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kilograms}}{\\text{height in meters}^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function Name: Your function should be named calculate_bmi.\n",
    "* Parameters: The function should accept two parameters:\n",
    ">weight: The weight of the person in kilograms.\\\n",
    "height: The height of the person in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Return Value: The function should return the calculated BMI value rounded to two decimal places.\n",
    "* User Input: After defining the function, prompt the user to input their weight and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** Display the calculated BMI to the user along with a health category:The BMI categories are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5\n",
    "* Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9\n",
    "* Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9\n",
    "* Obesity: BMI is 30 or greater\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Challenge**\n",
    "Extend your program to also accept weight in pounds and height in inches. Convert these values to kilograms and meters respectively, before calculating the BMI. Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 kilogram is approximately 2.20462 pounds.\n",
    "1 meter is approximately 39.3701 inches.\n"
